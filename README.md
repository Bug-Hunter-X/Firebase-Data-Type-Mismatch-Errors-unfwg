# Firebase Data Type Mismatch Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult-to-debug, issue in Firebase: receiving data from the database that doesn't match the expected data type.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access data without proper type validation, potentially leading to errors. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to mitigate this by implementing robust type checking and data validation before processing the data.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `firebaseBug.js`. Observe the error that occurs due to the type mismatch.
3. Run `firebaseBugSolution.js`. Observe that this version correctly handles the type mismatch and prevents errors.

## Solution

The key to solving this issue is to always validate the data type received from Firebase before using it.  Use appropriate type checking techniques (e.g., `typeof`, `instanceof`) and handle cases where the data isn't in the expected format gracefully.
